# Heart-Disease

People with heart disease require a good understanding of heart failure in 
order to minimize exacerbation of the disease process and maintain quality of life.Recent clinical guidelines recommend that clinicians counsel persons with heart failure about lifestyle modifications such as medications, a low sodium diet, activity modifications, as well as symptoms of deterioration. It is especially important to learn 
whether people with heart failure have an adequate understanding of heart failure or not, in order to enable them they should participate in their own self-care.This project determines the presence of heart disease based on the dataset available in UCI repository.
